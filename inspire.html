        <h2>Why is Jesus my hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone we look up to and use as an example of the kind of person we want to be. In my life, this person is Jesus Christ. </p>
        <p>His unconditional love, grace, and compassion for others is inspiring. I live every day trying to be more like him, but I know I will never measure up. </p>
